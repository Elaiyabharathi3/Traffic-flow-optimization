# Traffic-flow-optimization
ðŸ“Œ Introduction


Urban traffic congestion is a growing concern that affects travel efficiency, increases pollution, and strains public infrastructure. This project aims to develop a data-driven approach to optimize traffic flow using real-time data analytics, predictive modeling, and intelligent traffic control systems.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective


Analyze real-time and historical traffic data.

Identify congestion hotspots and traffic patterns.

Optimize traffic signal timings dynamically using machine learning.

Minimize travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions.

Support urban traffic planners with actionable insights.

ðŸ“Š Data Sources
Data can be collected from various open and private sources, including:

Traffic sensors and surveillance cameras.

GPS data from public transit or ride-sharing platforms.

Open Traffic APIs (Google Maps API, HERE, OpenStreetMap).

City open data portals (traffic logs, accident data, road work info).

IoT-enabled smart traffic systems.
